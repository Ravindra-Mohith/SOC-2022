1.Angular App:
  I did this app by creating angular basic abstracts... This is actually a news web app which sorts in according to the news type.
  I collected the API from newsAPI.org which provides free data APIs.From that i imported http client and I used get requests to extract data and keeping onto screen with beautiful UI.
  
2.MEAN app:
  firstly, hit `npm i` to install all node_modules go to parent repo and hit nodemon server.js to run backend. In other terminal, hit `ng serve` to run frontend. this is a basic full stack app which connects to your local mongo db, and does the CRUD operations through backend(EXPRESS.js) with help of beautiful frontend UI(ANGULAR.js).
